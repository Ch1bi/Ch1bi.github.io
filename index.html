        <p>I wasn't always a developer. I actually started doing my undergrad in Graphic Design. I began reading articles on creating mobile and web apps, and soon after I decided to take the dive. While doing my undergrad, I created video games, and mixed my skills with design and programming to create interactive experiences.</p>
            
        <p> Now I use my skills in design and programming where I create beautiful and interactive experiences for myself and clients.</p>

                                <h2>Process</h2>
                                <p>My process for developing this landing page was straightforward. I used HTML, CSS, and a bit of React to build out a landing page for a client. During this I did learn a few things as far as working on an exisiting codebase, and interacting with the client.</p>

                                <h2>01. Finding the client</h2>
                                <p>I initially found the client online through a forum. They needed help with the frontend of their site since they were primarily a backend developer. Before anything, the client wanted to know if I knew React, see examples of my work, and my Github. Once I showed these items, we decided to schedule a video call.</p>


                                <h2>02. Client's Request</h2>
                                <p>During the video call, the client explained that they wanted a revamp of their homepage, with a few ideas. After the video call I got to work doing some research and began to look through the code.</p>

                                <h2>03. Getting started</h2>
                                <p>Initially when I looked through the code, I felt overwhelmed. The client's project was surprisingly well developed with React + Redux. I took a moment to relax then began to look through the code to get a feel where everything is, and to get a sense of their coding style. If I didn't know where or how a particular component connected to one another, I would ask the client a question, and they explained it to me.</p>

                                <h2>04. Coding</h2>
                                <p>I wanted the clients homepage to have a large hero image to draw the customers in, followed by the services and the details of each thst they offered. During this process before doing anything, I asked the client what they thought. This way, everything went smoothly. Once completed, I had to make minor adjustments to the other pages to finish up the project. </p>

                                <h2>05. Takeaways</h2>
                                <p>During this process I learned a few things. Probably the biggest lesson I learned is when looking a new codebase to take things easy. Although it can sometimes be overwhelming, its just code and to take things line by line. The other thing I learned is that communication between yourself and the client is paramount. There were times when I didn't understand something and I needed to ask the client for clarification. If I would've went on as if I understood everything out of fear that I would seem incompetent I could've ruined the project as well as potential work done the line. So I feel it's best to ask for help when needed.</p>

                                <p>During the creation of this game, my responsibilities were mainly designing the art assets. There were two other developers who worked on the code for the game, and I would pitch in whenever the team needed a extra hand. During this experience, there was a lot of learning because we didn't know Unity3D.</p>

                                <h2>01. Client's Request</h2>
                                <p>One of my team members at the company where I worked, had a client that wanted a game. Being that the team was interested in game development we decided to take on the project. The client wanted an infinite runner but didn't know what type of game. The team and I decided to brainstorm and we decided on a ninja dog (Shiba Inu) infinite runner.</p>



                                <h2>02. Getting started</h2>
                                <p>We immediately decided to break up tasks for this project depending on our strengths. Due to my background in design, I was tasked with the art assets, and my two other team members would take care of the programming. I decided to do a bit research and see what kind of art style would suit the game. I decided to go with a silhoutte art style and went to sketching ideas for the game. </p>

                                <h2>03. Sketches & Vectoring</h2>
                                <p>Once I had an idea of the art style, I needed to figure out the theme. I started thinking of things such as ninja stars, samurais, pagodas  and began to look at reference materials from Google. Soon after I began sketching then moved to using Adobe Illustrator to begin vectoring. Once I finished vectoring I began to mix and match assets to create the backgrounds for the game.</p>

                                <h2>04. Coding</h2>
                                <p>A lot of this project was learning how to code using the Unity3D engine. Noone on the team was proficient using Unity3D. For this infinite runner, we looked up guides on C#, how to use physics within the game, how to create animations, and the logic for the game. It was a lot, we learned a lot.</p>

                                <h2>05. Takeaways</h2>
                                <p>Game Development IS NOT easy! I think this is the biggest takeaway from the process. When we began, we didn't fully realize the work that went into creating a game - graphics, sounds, animations, etc.  Besides that, we learned how to work as a team and use everyone's strength to push the product forward.</p>
